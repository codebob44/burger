# burger
This application is a burger logger created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app utilizes MVC design pattern, uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app  stores every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.
